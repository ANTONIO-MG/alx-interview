Overview
The "0. Star Wars Characters" project involves creating a script that interacts with the Star Wars API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. The script will print the names of all characters in a specified Star Wars movie.

Key Concepts
To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with several key concepts:

Web Programming: Understanding the basics of web protocols and how to interact with web servers.
API Interaction: Knowing how to send requests to APIs and handle responses.
Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript: Using asynchronous functions and promises to handle API requests without blocking the execution flow.
Requirements
Movie ID Argument: The script should accept a single positional argument, which is the Movie ID (e.g., 3 for "Return of the Jedi").
Character Names: The script should fetch and display the names of all characters in the movie, in the same order as they appear in the characters list in the /films/ endpoint.
Star Wars API: The script must interact with the Star Wars API.
Request Module: The script must use the request module to make HTTP requests.
