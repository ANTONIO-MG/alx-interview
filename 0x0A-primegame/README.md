0x0A. Prime Game
Description
This project involves solving a competitive game scenario using your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization. The challenge requires determining the winner of a game where two players, Maria and Ben, take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

You will implement an algorithm to determine the winner of multiple rounds of this game, assuming both players play optimally. The solution should efficiently handle up to 10,000 rounds with different starting sets.

Concepts
Prime Numbers
Understanding prime numbers and their properties.
Implementing efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers within a given range.
Sieve of Eratosthenes
A highly efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit, which is particularly useful for this task.
Game Theory
Basic principles of competitive games, including optimal play and win conditions.
Strategic decision-making to maximize the chances of winning.
Dynamic Programming/Memoization
Techniques for optimizing solutions by reusing previously computed results, particularly useful for handling multiple rounds efficiently.
Python Programming
Mastery of loops, conditional statements, and list management to implement the game logic.
Efficient handling of large datasets and complex operations.
